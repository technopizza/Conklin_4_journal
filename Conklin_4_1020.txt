Are you? Why or why not?
	Yes, because I worked on them at home.
This is a real question -- describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
	Slowly Iused myknowledge of geometry and trignometry to write math based methods
Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals (as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
	No. I was not looking for it.
Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
	No. I did not really need help.
Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.
	private void drawSquare(GraphicsContext gc, double[] centerpoint, double side) {
//               double x=side/2;
//               gc.setStroke(Color.BROWN);
//               gc.setLineWidth(5);
//               gc.strokePolygon(new double[]{centerpoint[0] - x, centerpoint[0] + x, centerpoint[0] + x, centerpoint[0] - x},
//                       new double[]{centerpoint[1] + x, centerpoint[1] + x, centerpoint[1] - x, centerpoint[1] - x}, 4);
