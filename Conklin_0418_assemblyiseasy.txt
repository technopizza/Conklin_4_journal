For what computational reason did you type elf64?
	to tell the computer to format the assembly code  into an object file using elf64
Why did you use ld?
	ld links the sample.asm object to sample.o executable file
Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?
	because sample is an object file
Now - change the code to print your name. You should change the program so that it actually prints your name.
Post the code in your journal

global _start
        section .text
_start:
        ; write(1, message, 13)
        mov     rax, 1
        mov     rdi, 1
        mov     rsi, message
        mov     rdx, 15
        syscall

        ; exit(0)
        mov     eax, 60
        xor     rdi, rdi
        syscall

What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?
	Changing the output text
Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?
	No. Assembly requires thorough knowledge of low level systems
What does 'low level' actually mean with regards to programming languages?
	Low level means similar to machine code
