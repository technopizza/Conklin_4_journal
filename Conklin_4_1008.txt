What are your tentative thoughts / plans for your art project?
	I'm going to re-create my processing program
What might be methods you will use?
	I will need a method to update the positions of all the objects on the screen
How might you incorporate a for loop?
	I will use a for loop tocycle through an array of objects
How might you incorporate, if, else if, else?
	If will incorporate if/else to check if an object is outside of the screen
What math might you use? 
	if(object.ypos > screenheight){
		object.ypos = 0;}
