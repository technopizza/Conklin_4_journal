What does the code below do?

the code prints out a 9 by 9 grid of chars. whatever each value in the array is determines which character  each place in the grid will display

How could you make it print an X? i.e., what array values would you change?

for (int i = 0; i < map.length - 1; i++){
	map[i][i] = 'X';
	map[map.length - (1+i)][map.length - (1+i)] = 'X';
} 

How could you use this to make a 5 in a row game?

We could have the program iterate through the grid verically, horizontally, and diagonally using 3 spereate for loops.
Just make  the for loops keep track of characters in a row and if it is equal to 5, the game is over.
