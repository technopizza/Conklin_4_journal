Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.

	int cubeNumber(int number){
		return number * number * number;
	}

Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.
	
	int cubeNumber(int number){
		return number * number * number;
	}

Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student

	public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int grade;
    private int seatNumber;

    public Student(String name, int grade) {
        this.name = name;
        this.grade = grade;
    }

    public int getGrade() {
        return grade;
    }

    public void setGrade(int grade) {
        this.grade = grade;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getSeatNumber() {
        return seatNumber;
    }

    public void setSeatNumber(int seatNumber) {
        this.seatNumber = seatNumber;
    }
    
    
}

Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?

I would improve upon my home automation project to create  more expansive platform for home automation 
including a video monitoring system, text messaging, etc.
