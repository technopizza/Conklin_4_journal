for frames to add to the Animation.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
	We are trying to learn general coding concepts. Slick is merely a tool to get us there. We want to memorize the coding practices, not the Slick syntax
What is an array?
	An array is a static length list of items with same data type
How do you make an array? Give an example.
	int[] myArray = new int[2];
What is an ArrayList?
	An arraylist is a variable-length list of different objects.
How do you make an arraylist?

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?

add()
indexOf()
size()

What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
