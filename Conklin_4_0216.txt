Describe: How was an array used in your Slick game?


An array was used for checking the blocked status of tiles.
It was a two dimensional array that used indeces to represent coordinates

What might be another use for an array in a different program?

An array would be a good way to keep track of a list of items with an unchanging length
 - perhaps the planets around a solar system?
