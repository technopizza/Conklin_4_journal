fruit[0] = "Bob";

What does this do: private String[] dessert = new String[3];

This creates an empty private String array with 3 items

What does this do: private String[] postres = {"rice pudding", "pan dulce", "bunuelos"}

This creates a private string array with 3 items, but the items themselves are already defined

How are they different?

One is creating an empty array, while the other fills the array with items

How would we replace "bunuelos" with "apple pie"?

postres[2] = "apple pie";
