    In the Array Game assignment you have had to review and revisit concepts you may have forgotten about. These will all be tested on the final exam!
    What is an array?
	An array is a static length list of "things" of one particular type
    How does one make a simple array of Strings?
	String[] stringArray = new String{"Dog", "Cat", "Hamster"};
    What is the syntax for a 2-D array?
	int[][] my2DArray = new int[2][2];
    What is the syntax for a 3-D array?
	int[][][] my3dArray = new int[2][3][4];
    How does one change the value for the third value in a one dimensional array? [Give specific code]
	myarray[2] = 3;
    What is the syntax for a while loop?
	while(true){
		//do stuff
	}
    Why use while loops in your game?
	A while loop allows repetition so the game continues indefinitely
    Your game should be in a method outside of main --- How will you call your game in main?
	just call the game method
    Why was it recommended that you use .toLowerCase() with your Scanner input?
	This will make all input lowercase, allowing easier checks since you know it wil always be lowercase
    You should use different methods when moving the protagonist and to check for intersections. How? Why?
	Different functional elements of our game should be separated into different methods for more precise manipulation of data
    What values will you pass across methods? how? why?
	Things such as our 2D grid array and coordinates of the player should be passed, so that methods are used to modify the proper objects
