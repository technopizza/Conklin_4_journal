What slick game did you create?
	My game centers around an explorer collecting treasure
What challenges did you solve
	I solved the challenge of blocked tiles and gridlocked movement within the tile grid
Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
	We were told that we could work over break, but there was no sense of urgency in that admonishment. I did not finish my map over break. I was absent from home for much of break, as I was spending time with family and friends
Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
	No. I am almost done, but the time requirement to finish this game is not easily available to me, as I have a busy schedule.
